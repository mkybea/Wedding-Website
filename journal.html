<h1>Welcome to the Journal!</h1>

<p id="header2">This page has various written updates as we have been getting ready for our big day!  Check back periodically if you are interested in following us as we document our planning process!</p>

<p id="entry"> Oh my gosh, guys. It's been awhile since I updated anything about all that we've been doing!<br/>
Here is what has been going on over the past few months:<br/><br/>
- Katie had several appointments to get a wedding dress and <i>finally</i> chose one with the help of the Mother of the Bride and Maid of Honour.<br/>
- We've been working on gathering supplies for decorations.<br/>
- We've been researching photographers (we haven't decided on this yet).<br/>
- We got the save the dates sent out! Katie is really ecstatic about how amazing they turned out, so look for them in your mailbox! These were designed by the Bride's brother, James. You can visit his portfolio of works to see more of his designs <a href="http://jamesarnett.net/">here</a>.<br/>
- We finally decided on a caterer and the type of food we want! The delicious winner is a southern breakfast/brunch, y'all!  Our caterer is the fantastic team at Main Street Bakery and Catering in Luray, Virginia.  You can visit their site of delicious goods and services <a href="https://mainstreetbakery-catering.com/">here</a>.<br/>
- We made a small registry, though we prefer that you all just bring yourselves.  We are more than happy with all that we have already.  For those that insist on presents, the link to the registry can be found on our Registry page. <br/><br/>
That is all for now, guys!  We are looking forward to celebrating our big day with all of you! October is just around the corner now!
<br/><br/>
<i>Love, Matt and Katie.</i>

<p id="entry"> Hello again! It's just Katie this time!  And I've updated the website!<br/><br/>
I heard that the last one was hard to read (I do agree!), so here I am adding some updates.  It needed to be done anyway, and we have just been super lazy.  Unfortunately, this is about as 
far as we have gotten with planning the wedding thus far.  Our venue has been booked and we haven't had much time to do much else.  <br/><br/>I have discussed with my team (aka, my Maid of Honour, Katie, and my 
Mother) about wedding dress details.  My Mom and I looked at the possibility of sewing the wedding dress from a pattern and went searching for patterns at JoAnn's.  We found some, but I'm 
not entirely sure how well the styles might look on me.  Currently, the plan is now to set up an appointment to try on dresses at a store and see what styles might work best for all of us on 
the bridal team.  Once we have a style down, we can search up some patterns! <br/><br/>
In other news, the next big thing on the agenda is researching caterers.  Unfortunately, we haven't gotten very far with this.  What we have done, though, is figure out our top two 
choices on types of food to have!  You guys ready for this?!  It is... <br/><br/>
<i>Drumroll, please...</i><br/><br/>
1. Breakfast<br/>
2. BBQ<br/><br/>
What do you think?  We figured that since breakfast food is such a big theme between Matt and I, why not share it with everyone!?  Also... <b>MIMOSAS FOREVER!</b>  We also like BBQ, 
but that is just the #2 choice.<br/><br/>
That's it for now, guys!<br/><br/>
<i>Love, Matt and Katie.</i>

<p id="entryID1">January 21st, 2017</p>
<p id="entry">Hello, everyone!  Great news!  We have officially booked our venue!  Finally!
<br/>
<br/>
We researched about 50 different venues ranging in location from Charlottesville to Alexandria and settled on a small farm venue in the town of Culpeper.  
We feel the location will have plenty of space and is just the asthetic we are looking for (aka, something straight outta Pinterest, y'all!).  
You can check out the venue website <a href="http://rockhillfarmevents.com/">here.</a>  The date we have booked is for October 29th, 2017.  Now that we have the date, everything
 else will have to fall into place!<br/><br/>
 Again, the Wedding Date will be <b>October 29th, 2017</b>.<br/><br/>
Please be aware, even though the wedding is just before Halloween, it <b>will NOT</b> be a Halloween themed wedding.  Please: we don't want to see your Halloween costumes.  At least not until 
a little while after the reception has started and we have already downed a number of drinks.<br/><br/>
We are looking forward to the big day!
 <br/>
 <br/>
